//faq text
faq.q1=Who is behind DeliverBoo?
faq.a1=Imperatrice Suprema, Dea Suprema and Queen Fede.
faq.q2=How does DeliverBoo work?
faq.a2=The application allows you to order food or other products from restaurants and clubs and have them (hypothetically) delivered to your home.
faq.q3=What are the delivery costs?
faq.a3=Delivery costs vary depending on the venue and the service you choose.
faq.q4=How can I pay?
faq.a4=You can pay by credit card, PayPal or directly to the rider who will deliver the food to you.
faq.q5=How long does it take for delivery?
faq.a5=Delivery time depends on the restaurant or shop and the distance from your location.\nOn average, it takes us forever since the shops don't really exist.
faq.q6=What if my order is wrong or something is missing?
faq.a6=Upon delivery, you can complain to the rider and beat him. Send him to the afterlife :D
faq.q7=What happens if I get confused and order here instead of from real delivery apps (e.g. Deliveroo, JustEat, Glovo...) ?
faq.a7=We advise you to reorder on the site of your favorite service as soon as possible because you will not receive anything from us XD.
faq.q8=What happens if a rider actually arrives?
faq.a8=We advise you not to open because we have no idea who it is. It is your responsibility to ensure that no strangers enter your home.
faq.q9=Whose images are used in the application?
faq.a9=The images used within the application are owned by the members of the group, as they are hand-drawn,\ngenerated by Dall-E artificial intelligence, and created on the EA game "The Sims 4".
